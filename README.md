# Transformer-Based-Document-Retrieval-with-Fine-Tuned-Language-Models
An end-to-end implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for querying a 200-page book on data privacy. This project involves generating embeddings, fine-tuning a Qwen/Qwen1.5-4B model using LoRA, and evaluating its performance against the base model to test for accuracy and catastrophic forgetting.
